# website-y3
A simple, static website for SFS Year 3.

Interim site until one of the older websites is resurrected.  The site is very
basic and hosted on S3 + CloudFront.

All published pages and assets are in the _public/_ directory.

To update the published site, run the following:

    ./bin/deploy

You'll need your AWS credentials for the Seattle Flu account in your
environment or config files.
