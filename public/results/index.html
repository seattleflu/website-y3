    <h2>
      Thank you for your participation in the Seattle Flu Study.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once your results have been processed, you may access them in more detail via our secure web
      portal. This web portal provides results for all Seattle Flu Study (SFS) research participants,
      including the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) and the Husky Coronavirus Testing
      (HCT) programs.

    <p>
      As a reminder, SFS is not a clinical service or a replacement for medical care. If you are
      experiencing a severe illness such as difficulty breathing, please contact a doctor
      immediately.
      Once your swab has been returned to our lab, it may take 2-3 days for the status of your test
      result to be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      SFS tests for current COVID-19 illness. Our test cannot identify if you previously had
      COVID-19, and does not test for COVID-19 antibodies at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether or not your sample tests positive for COVID-19, we recommend you follow
      state, local and national guidelines for infection control and prevention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this portal only provides results and information for Seattle Flu Study
      research participants. It cannot provide results for users who have received testing from UW
      Medicine or other outlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you again for your participation.
