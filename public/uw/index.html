      <h2 id="about">About the Husky Coronavirus Testing Study</h2>
      <p>
        Starting in September, “Husky Coronavirus Testing,” a new project by the Seattle Flu Study team,
        will help us learn more about how COVID-19 spreads through the community and how we can stop it.
        For the health and safety of the UW community, University of Washington students, faculty, and
        staff across all three campuses will be able to sign up online, tell us about any symptoms or
        exposures, and have an opportunity to be tested.

  <h2 id="what-happens">What Happens if I Sign Up?</h2>
  <p>
    After reading about the study, you can click on a link below to enroll. If you sign up and
    consent to participate in this research, we would ask you to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Complete a baseline survey about your demographics, contact information, and housing
        situation
      </li>
      <li>
        You may be asked to visit a test center on site to be tested as soon as you enroll
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill out a short daily survey about whether or not you feel sick or may have been exposed to
        someone with COVID-19
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on need and risk, we may ask you to be tested for COVID-19 on occasion throughout the
        academic year, either at an on-campus test center or by a kit that we mail to your house.
        This would happen if you are feeling sick, or even if you are not having  any symptoms. We
        may request you to get tested even when you do not feel sick to detect COVID-19 in people
        without symptoms and to improve our understanding of how COVID-19 circulates in the
        community.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2 id="when-where">When and where will I get a test?</h2>
  <p>
    The majority of testing will be performed in-person at the University of Washington Seattle
    Campus. A small number of individuals, including those at UW Tacoma and UW Bothell, may be
    tested with a kit mailed directly to you. There are a few times we may ask you to be tested for
    COVID-19:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>At enrollment</b> if you are living on campus, in Greek Life, or with many other people
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>If you are feeling sick or have been exposed</b>, based on the daily capacity of our
        personnel, supplies and laboratory
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Each week</b>, we will be selecting a random sample of approximately 1,000 participants,
        and request that they be tested for COVID-19, regardless of if they have any symptoms.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="about-sfs">About the Seattle Flu Study</h2>
  <p>
    The Seattle Flu Study is an ongoing study initiated in 2018 to create a community-wide network
    to detect infectious disease outbreaks early and identify new ways to limit their spread.
    Ultimately, the findings from this study will help to inform the development of new systems to
    help prevent the spread of pandemics in Seattle and other metropolitan locations around the
    world.

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <p>
    <h3>What kind of swab is used for this test? Can I swab myself?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our research study uses Anterior Nasal Swabs for sample collection. These swabs are less
        invasive than most used for COVID-19 testing. These swabs only reach the front part of your
        nose. Participants may experience mild discomfort such as tickly or runny nose, watery eyes
        or sneezing. For the safety of our staff, participants will swab themselves. The swab is
        inserted into the nostril until you feel some resistance, which is normally about an inch.
        You should swab vigorously around the inside of each nostril for 5 seconds each.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How long will it take to receive my results?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It normally takes the lab 24-48 hours to process and return test results, although it can
        sometimes take longer than that.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What happens if my test result comes back positive?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stay home and self-isolate from others for 10 days since your test date. If you are
          experiencing symptoms, stay home for 10 days from when your symptoms started and 24 hours
          until your symptoms resolve. Do not go to work or class. If you live in a residence hall,
          notify the residence hall staff to help facilitate your self-isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The UW Environmental Health & Safety Department (EH&S) will reach out to you for follow
          up. They will ask standard questions to support your isolation and to prevent transmission
          on campus and among University community members. They will contact UW employees and
          students you may have been in contact with recently, and provide public health guidance.
          For more information, see
          <a href="https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/faq/#health" target="_blank">
            "What to do if I have confirmed COVID-19?"
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Do I have to get tested?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For the health and safety of the UW community, we encourage everyone to sign up, however,
        this study is completely voluntary. It is up to you if you would like to participate, and
        you can leave the study at any time without any penalty. The University of Washington will
        not be notified whether or not you decide to participate in the study.
      </li>
      <li>
        The UW’s interpretation of Washington state law is that mandatory testing, such as a
        condition of employment or a housing contract, is not permissible under current conditions.
        However, we hope everyone who will be at a UW campus or facility regularly will enroll and
        participate in the program in order to protect their health and the health of the community.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who will be informed of my test result?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The University of Washington Environmental Health and Safety team will be informed if you
          are positive to perform contact tracing and assist with any quarantine needs. Public
          Health &mdash; Seattle & King County (Seattle and Bothell campuses) or Tacoma-Pierce
          County Health Department (Tacoma campus), along with the Washington Department of Health
          are informed of COVID-19 test results to provide assistance and perform contact tracing,
          if needed.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>How long does the study last?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This study will run through the academic year from September 2020 until June 2021.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is the goal of the study that powers Husky Coronavirus Testing?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The goal of the study that powers Husky Coronavirus Testing is to monitor for new cases of
        the novel coronavirus in the UW community. This will allow the UW to provide support to
        individuals who test positive, as well as to better understand transmission among the
        community, including symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. The findings from this study will
        help to inform the development of new systems to help prevent the spread of pathogens on
        college campuses and other educational facilities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who has access to my data? How will my information be shared?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your privacy is extremely important to us! Only the research team will have access to the
        information that you provide. No data directly linked to you will ever be made publicly
        available. To protect access to your results, you will be given a personal barcode.
      </li>
      <li>
        All study information will be stored in a secure, confidential manner. We will also store
        aggregated information separately from your personal information in order to understand
        trends in how coronavirus is spreading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Washington State law also requires that we report certain conditions (including COVID-19) to
        Local Health Jurisdictions and the Department of Health. If your sample tests positive for
        one of these conditions, these organizations may contact you to ask you additional
        questions. They will keep your information private.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where can I get tested?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are two planned locations on Seattle campus to be tested: one at the UW Club, and one
        on the first floor of Odegaard Hall. There is another planned location at the University of
        Washington Medical Center at South Lake Union that will be opening later this fall.
      </li>
      <li>
        If UW Bothell or UW Tacoma is your main campus, or you do not attend work or classes in
        person, you may be tested at home using a kit that is mailed directly to you. These kits
        will contain all of the materials and instructions you need to take the test accurately and
        safely.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When should I get re-tested?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you come into contact with someone who is experiencing symptoms or ends up with a
        positive COVID-19 test result. Additionally, if you attend social gatherings with 10 or more
        individuals, inside and without masks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is CommonCircle?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The CommonCircle is an exposure notification app that helps to identify possible exposures
        to COVID-19 cases using Bluetooth proximity notification through the privacy-preserving
        Apple Google API. <a href="https://commoncircle.us" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
